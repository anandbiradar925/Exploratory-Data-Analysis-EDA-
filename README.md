Titanic Dataset – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project Overview: This project was completed as part of my Data Science Internship at HexSoftware. The objective of the project is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset, clean the data, and extract meaningful insights related to passenger survival. EDA plays a critical role in understanding data structure, identifying patterns, and preparing clean data for further machine learning tasks.

Objectives: Understand the structure and quality of the Titanic dataset Perform data cleaning and preprocessing Handle missing values and outliers Analyse relationships between features and survival outcome Visualise key insights using Python

Tools & Technologies: Programming Language: Python Libraries: Pandas NumPy Matplotlib Seaborn Environment: Jupyter Notebook

Dataset Description The Titanic dataset contains information about passengers such as: Gender Age Passenger Class (Pclass) Fare Embarkation Point Survival Status

Key Steps Performed

Data Understanding Dataset inspection Shape, data types, and summary statistics

Data Cleaning Handling missing values (Age, Embarked, etc.) Feature formatting and correction Removing or analysing outliers

Exploratory Data Analysis Univariate analysis (distribution of features) Bivariate analysis (feature vs survival) Visual analysis using plots and charts

Key Insights: Gender Impact: Female passengers had a significantly higher survival rate than males Passenger Class: First-class passengers had better survival chances Age Factor: Children showed higher survival probability Fare Influence: Higher fare-paying passengers were more likely to survive Embarkation Point: Survival rates varied across embarkation locations

Conclusion The analysis highlights how demographic and socio-economic factors influenced survival during the Titanic disaster. This project helped build a strong foundation in data cleaning, EDA, and data storytelling, which is essential for Data Analyst and Data Science roles.

Learning Outcomes: Hands-on experience with real-world data Improved data preprocessing and analytical skills Ability to extract and communicate insights from data Strong understanding of EDA workflow
